      <h2>What are NFTs?</h2>
      <p>NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are unique digital assets that are verified on a blockchain network. Unlike fungible tokens such as cryptocurrencies, NFTs cannot be exchanged for other tokens on a one-to-one basis as they have unique characteristics and cannot be replicated.</p>

      <h2>How do NFTs work?</h2>
      <p>NFTs are created on a blockchain network, typically using a smart contract, which defines the specific attributes and characteristics of the asset. The ownership and transfer of the NFT is recorded on the blockchain, which provides a transparent and immutable ledger of transactions.</p>

      <h2>How to create and trade NFTs</h2>
      <p>To create an NFT, you need to first choose a blockchain platform that supports NFTs, such as Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain. You can then use a platform or service that allows you to mint your own NFTs, such as OpenSea or Rarible.</p>
      <p>To trade NFTs, you can use a marketplace such as OpenSea or Nifty Gateway, where you can buy and sell NFTs with other users. Transactions are typically conducted using cryptocurrency such as Ether or Bitcoin.</p>
